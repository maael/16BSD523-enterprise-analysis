\section{Company Resources}

When founding Spotify, Ek had already gained first-hand experience from other companies that he had worked at and founded in the past: most notably Advertigo, an online advertising company \parencite{Alexander2013}. Aged 14 he founded a web services company, taking on a variety of roles such as programmer, system administrator, designer, and product manager, learning many skills that he would later draw upon to found Spotify \parencite{wired_influencer}.

\subsection{In the Beginning} \label{resources:beginning}

Spotify was created only a decade ago \parencite{spotify_story_so_far, spotify_whois}, available exclusively in Sweden. In fact 2006 was only its initial launch, beginning to accept members on an invitation only basis 2 years later \parencite{spotify_story_so_far}.

%\subsubsection{Knowledge and information}

The licensing of music is important for Spotify, allowing it to be streamed to users for free or as part of a subscription. When the company first started out the idea of giving away music for free was entirely new, and many were sceptical about the model. However in Sweden where Spotify was founded, the music industry was already beginning to experience a paradigm shift that would later propagate around the globe, transitioning to the vast majority of revenue coming from live music and events instead of recorded media \parencite{Johansson2009}.

Another key point about how Spotify was able to convince record companies came to light in 2009, when it was revealed that Spotify had sold 18\% of their shares to five of the world's largest record companies. At its public launch, in October 2008, these shares were sold for just under 100,000 SEK (less than \$14,000) \parencite{Jerrang2009}. Putting this into perspective, Spotify was valued at \$250M just under a year after launch \parencite{Arrington2009}, meaning that these shares were sold for 0.03\% of their near-future value. However had Spotify been unable to secure sources for its digital music library, their \$250 post-launch valuation would not have been possible.

%\subsubsection{Key people} \label{resources:beginning:keypeople}

One particularly interesting trait of Ek's, is that he could have easily retired at 23 after selling his advertising company, Advertigo, for \$1.25M. Ek did actually retire for a brief amount of time, but found himself `completely depressed' and without direction \parencite{Taube2014}.

Spotify was co-founded by Ek and Martin Lorentzon, as the solution to their problem of driving music evolution and providing a universal jukebox \parencite{ft_spotify}. That Spotify arose due to a love of music is an important detail, the desire of its co-founders to fill a gap that they identified themselves then resolved to fill, as it explains their drive and dedication to their product.

Prior to co-founding Spotify, Ek was briefly the CEO of $\mu$torrent where he met Ludvig Strigeus \parencite{ft_lunch_ek}. This shaped how Spotify would be made at a fundamental level, as Strigeus's knowledge of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks was used in the initial design and development of the application. This architecture persisted as a method to deliver music to users in Spotify from its creation until 2014, as it allowed the service to scale with the demand from its growing user base as needed \parencite{how_spotify_works, spotify_shut_down_p2p}. This approach was likely phased out due to falling bandwidth prices, with Spotify taking on the burden of increasing its own bandwidth usage instead of leveraging its users bandwidth to help serve up music, as well as the increase in popularity of Spotify's mobile apps \parencite{spotify_shut_down_p2p}.

Another key individual hired early on in Spotify's creation was Jonathan Forster. Prior to joining Spotify Forster had experience in sales and management roles at ValueClick \parencite{forster_linkedin}, and he went on to use this experience in other similar roles that he held over his years working for Spotify. One of his original roles at Spotify was to talk to record companies and help acquire licenses and master rights, which were vital as they were needed for the music core to Spotify's services, as the music selection available directly affects the services value to their users \parencite{jforsterinterview1, jforsterinterview2}.

%\subsubsection{Physical Resources}

During development, Spotify ran out of a small amount of servers in Ek's apartment \parencite{JordanCrook2015}. By Spotify's 2008 launch, this had grown to 20 servers \parencite{Garcia2013}. As the company's user base grew, one tough challenge was to ensure that their servers grew in parallel, helped by P2P networking, to provide maximal uptime of music streaming services.

%\subsubsection{Funding}

In the early days, Ek and Lorentzon worked from Ek's apartment, \parencite{JordanCrook2015}. The relatively small amounts of resources they required, such as servers and infrastructure it is assumed was easy affordable thanks to both of their backgrounds. The first official investment in Spotify was in October 2008. The first round of funding, Series A, received \$21.64M from four investors Creandum, Horizons Ventures, Li Ka-shing and Northzone \parencite{Broeders2016}. 

\subsection{Present Day}

Spotify has grown to be one of the largest and most well-known tech companies in the world \parencite{Nusca2016}, with over 40M paid subscribers \parencite{40m_spotify}, and over 100M users registered worldwide \parencite{Glenday2016}.

%\subsubsection{Knowledge and information}

Spotify's library has grown to over 30M songs \parencite{Spotify2016b}, and is rapidly expanding. Despite this, there is still controversy surrounding the total revenue that reaches artists. One artist revealed details of their payments from Spotify with over 1M streams, and receiving only \$4,955.90, an average of \$0.004891 per-stream \parencite{Resnikoff2016}. Taylor Swift removed her content from Spotify in 2014, making a stand against low royalties \parencite{Ellis-Petersen2014}. 

%\subsubsection{Key people}

Through all of the highs and lows, Ek has remained at the core of the company in his role as CEO. He also became Chairman in October 2015, when Lorentzon stepped down into the vice-chairman position \parencite{lunden2016}.

Forster did however leave the company recently, in September of this year, supposedly to work on developing various start-ups that he has invested in \parencite{Glenday2016}. 

%\subsubsection{Physical Resources}

Spotify now has offices in 20 locations across the globe \parencite{Spotify2016}. Their servers are currently running off of over 5,000 servers, with 140Gbps of internet capacity, from four datacentres around the world: Stockholm, London, Ashburn (East-US), San Jose (West-US) \parencite{Garcia2013}. Spotify owns the server hardware however utilities and space are rented.

To help scale their servers, Spotify developed several tools that they have since open-sourced. Most notably this includes `helios', a Docker container orchestration framework \parencite{Github2016}, which they used to drastically increase their production efficiency \parencite{Vanlan2015}.

In early 2016 Spotify announced that they would be moving their entire platform to Google's Cloud Platform \parencite{Henderson2016}. Moving to cloud services is a growing trend for tech companies, with Netflix also transitioning to Amazon Web Services in January 2016 \parencite{Brodkin2016}. Cloud services offer advantages to companies such as scale, automated deployment, cheaper costs and redundancy. Additionally they may have improved environmental impact, as mentioned in Section \ref{macro} although this is dependent upon the cloud service provider.

%\subsubsection{Funding}

At the start of 2016 30M of Spotify's 100M users were paying subscribers, with that number growing over the course of the year to be 40M by the middle of September the same year \parencite{30m_spotify, 40m_spotify}. Despite this Spotify continues to lose money, and has done every year since launch, never turning over a profit. In 2015 Spotify's profit was \EUR{-173M}, despite revenue of nearly \EUR{2B} \parencite{Titcomb2016}.

In March 2016, Spotify raised \$1B in debt financing to help take on rivals Apple Music, as well as Tidal and Google Music \parencite{Reynolds2016}. Conditions of this include an increasing discount on the price of public shares of the company, fuelling growing rumours of the company's likely initial public offering (IPO).

Spotify's subscription price has remained at (\textsterling/\EUR{}/\$)9.99/month for Premium. Previously they offered an `Unlimited' plan for half of this price, without some of the additional Premium features such as offline playback and higher bitrate, however this has been being phased out since 2014 \parencite{Fisque2013}. Additionally Spotify offers Premium at half price for students \parencite{Spotify2016c}.

Spotify was valued at \$8.58B in 2015 \parencite{Davidson2015}.
