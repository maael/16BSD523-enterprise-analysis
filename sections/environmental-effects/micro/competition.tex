Since its formation in 2006 a number of competitors have spawned with a similar music streaming model, seen in Table \ref{table:competitors}.

The first three competitors have world-recognised brands backing them, helping to promote their services. Owned by Jay-Z and backed by celebrities \parencite{tidal_launch_issues}, Tidal is predominantly for those looking for high resolution music, and a fairer deal for artists by apparently paying double the royalties of other services \parencite{tidal_launch_issues}. Deezer does not have any such backing, however until recently it was the second largest on-demand streaming service, gaining users by often being bundled with mobile contracts \parencite{music_streaming_guardian}.

There also exists threats from outside established music subscription services. Pandora is an online music radio service, similar by connecting users and music, but with a key difference by not being on-demand with the service deciding what music to serve. Pandora however has plans to expand into on-demand music \parencite{pandora_subscription}, representing a significant competitor as an established service in America with 78M users, close to Spotify's own 100M user base.
