Internally Spotify initially used a Scrum based development approach, originally presented in 1995 \parencite[][118]{scrum_paper, spotify_eng_culture_1} and rapidly growing in popularity around Spotify's creation \parencite{scrumalliance_membership_2014}. However issues were soon faced with Scrum once Spotify started to grow, changing to a custom Agile approach for its own use which others in the industry would later look to learn from \parencite{spotify_eng_culture_1, spotify_eng_culture_2, spotify_agile_article, emulating_spotifys_matrix, scaling_agile_spotify_scrum, how_spotify_scales}.
