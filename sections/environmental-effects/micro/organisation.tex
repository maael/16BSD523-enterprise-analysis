\subsubsection{Organisation}
Internally Spotify started out using a Scrum based development approach, originally presented in 1995 \parencite[][118]{scrum_paper, spotify_eng_culture_1} but rapidly growing in popularity around the time of Spotify's launch \parencite{scrumalliance_membership_2014}. However Spotify soon faced issues with Scrum once it started to grow and so tailored a more general Agile approach for its own use which others in the industry would later look to and learn from \parencite{spotify_eng_culture_1, spotify_eng_culture_2, spotify_agile_article, emulating_spotifys_matrix, scaling_agile_spotify_scrum, how_spotify_scales}.
