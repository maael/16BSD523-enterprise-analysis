Spotify is heavily steeped in legal and political issues, which are often closely tied together, as the company has brought a variety of topics and laws into question. This comes from their dependency on music licensing and copyrighting to distribute content from a variety of different groups, as well as the streaming access-based model that they use. Legal issues have been one of the main controlling factors for Spotify's initial growth, as to gather more content they were required to acquire the necessary rights and licenses. Indeed early when Spotify began to gain popularity there were questions about its legal status, as it was one of the first times the `freemium' model of free music with extra paid subscription services was seen in a music service \parencite{spotify_legal_question, spotify_just_begin}.

The legality of licensing is problematic for Spotify due to its nature as a streaming service, meaning that many of the responsibilities usually placed on publishers for distributing royalties are instead placed on Spotify \parencite{spotify_legal_tangle_billboard}. To combat this administrative complication Spotify has looked to create a database to enable it to properly manage royalties and payments \parencite{spotify_royalties_database, spotify_royalties_database_billboard}. Despite these efforts Spotify has still ended up in legal cases for lacking proper licenses and not paying royalties properly \parencite{spotify_legal_tangle_billboard, spotify_second_lawsuit, spotify_publishers_settlement}.
