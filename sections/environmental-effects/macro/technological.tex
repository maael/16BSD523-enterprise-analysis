\subsubsection{Technological}
Released only as a desktop application, Spotify has grown to be available on web and mobile platforms as well. Apple launched the App Store in 2008, with 2 billion app downloads by the end of the year, and Google launched the Android Market the same year. Shortly after this Spotify created its mobile app, launching in 2009 \parencite{apple_app_store_first_weekend, telegraph_top_10_highlights_2009, androind_market_release, spotify_mobile_release}. Further changes at Spotify include those talked about in Section \ref{environment:suppliers}, namely that improvements in available technology and reduction in prices made cloud services affordable enough for Spotify to transition to using them \parencite{spotify_announce_google_cloud}. Another touched upon technological change includes the use of a peer-to-peer network and eventual transition to the more conventional client/server approach as discussed in Section \ref{resources:beginning:keypeople}.
